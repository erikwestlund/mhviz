# Data Simulation

To simulate data, we implement our causal model. We will start by simulating data for root nodes or exogenous nodes (i.e., those without arrows going into them).

## States/Geography

Using data from the Census and the Commonwealth Fund health grades, we'll generate a data frame with some state-level data. This data will be used to generate state-level variables for patients, such as the political/economic conditions related to health. It will also be used to structure the distribution of race/ethnicity in the population per state.

```{r gen_state}

## Population Data from US Census 2020. Combined with health scores from Commonwealth Fund
## Health Scorecard data.  The weights measure is based upon population data from the Census.
## `pec` is a z-score of the rank of the state in terms of population and used as a 
## measure of state political & economic conditions with respect to health.
## This data is for illustration purposes only.
state_population_data <- read.csv("data/states_census2020_ranks.csv") |> 
  mutate(state_weight = population/sum(population)) |> 
   mutate(
    inverted_rank = max(rank) + 1 - rank,  # Invert ranks (lower is better)
    pec = scale(inverted_rank, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)[, 1]  # Z-score (normal distribution)
  ) |> 
  select(-inverted_rank) 


# Load in data on race/ethnicity population from states. This is from the Census2020 file.
# It uses their one-race only and separates  Hispanic from non-Hispanic. The weights
# are just the proportion of the population of one category vs the sum of the population in
# all race/ethnicity categories. 
# This data is meant for illustration purposes only.
state_data <- readr::read_csv("data/race_by_state_census2020.csv") |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = -"Label",
               names_to = "State",
               values_to = "Population") |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = "Label", values_from = Population) |>
  mutate(across(-State, ~ as.numeric(gsub(",", "", .)))) |>
  rename(
    state = State,
    white = White,
    black = Black,
    hispanic = "Hispanic or Latino",
    asian = Asian,
    aian = "American Indian and Alaska Native",
    nhpi = "Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander",
    other = Other,
  ) |> mutate(
    sum = white + hispanic + black + asian + aian + other + nhpi,
    white = white / sum,
    black = black / sum,
    hispanic = hispanic / sum,
    asian = asian / sum,
    aian = aian / sum,
    other = other / sum,
    nhpi = nhpi / sum,
  ) |>
  rename(state_name = state) |>
  select(-sum) |>
  left_join(state_population_data |> select(state_name, state, state_weight, pec)) |>
  filter(!is.na(state))

state_data |> kable()

readr::write_csv(state_data, "data/state_data.csv")
```

## Providers

We need to generate providers.  We will have a provider for roughly every 100 patients. We will generate a provider quality measure which is mostly random, but determined partially by state political and economic considerations with respect to health.

Providers will vary by state population. We below show a random sample of 50 providers.

```{r gen_providers}

providers <- state_data |>
  slice(rep(1:n(), each = 1)) |>
  arrange(state) |>
  mutate(
    id = 1:n(),
  ) |> 
  select(id, state, pec)

remaining_providers <- n_providers - nrow(providers)

additional_providers <- data.frame(
  id = (nrow(providers) + 1):n_providers,
  state = sample(state_data$state, remaining_providers, replace = TRUE, prob = state_data$state_weight)
) |> 
  left_join(state_data |> select(state, pec), by = "state")

providers <- bind_rows(providers, additional_providers) |> 
  mutate(
    quality = gen_provider_quality(n_providers, pec)
  ) |> 
  arrange(id) |> 
  select(id, state, quality)

providers |> sample_n(50) |>  kable()

```

## Patients

We'll start by generating a date frame with patients. We will generate a state for each patient based on the population of each state. We will randomly assign a race/ethnicity based upon state-level proportions. We will then assign that person to a provider in their state.

```{r gen_ind}

# Start by creating a dataframe with patients having state IDs proportional to
# the population of each state. Then row-wise generate race/ethnicity categories.
data <- data.frame(state = sample(
  state_data$state,
  n,
  replace = TRUE,
  prob = state_data$state_weight
)) |>
  merge(state_data |> select(state, pec, re_cats), by = "state") |>
  rowwise() |>
  mutate(race = sample(re_cats, size = 1, prob = c_across(all_of(re_cats)))) |>
  ungroup() |>
  select(-re_cats) |> 
  mutate(id = row_number())

data |> sample_n(10) |> kable()
```

## Assign Patient to Provider

```{r patient_to_provider}

data <- data |> 
  rowwise() |>
  mutate(provider_id = sample(providers$id[providers$state == state], 1)) |>
  ungroup()  |> 
  left_join(providers |> select(id, quality), by = c("provider_id" = "id")) |> 
  select(id, provider_id, quality, state, pec, race) |> 
  rename(
    provider_quality = quality
  )
  

data |> sample_n(10) |> kable()

```


## Exogenous Nodes

Now every patient has a state, a provider, a race/ethnicity, and some associated data by state.

In addition to race/ethnicity and state, the following variables have no prior causes in our model:

* `AGE`: Age of the patient.
* `PCE`: Parent community connections
* `PED`: Parent education
* `PI`: Parent intelligence
* `PM`: Parent motivation
* `PSR`: Parent resilience


We will generate `n` observations for each of these variables.

```{r data_exog}

## Next generate all the other exogenous variables
# We need to assign a provider to each patient. This provider needs a quality
data <- data |>
  mutate(
    age = gen_mother_ages(n),
    parent_income = gen_incomes(
      n,
      median_income = 60000,
      sd = 25000,
      min_income = 0,
      max_income = 1000000
    ),
    parent_intelligence = rnorm(n, 1, 1),
    parent_resilience = rnorm(n, 1, 1),
    parent_motivation = rnorm(n, 1, 1),
    parent_community_connections = rnorm(n, 0, 1),
    parent_edu = gen_education(n, ed_cats, parent_intelligence, parent_resilience, parent_motivation, parent_community_connections, parent_income),
  )

data |> sample_n(10) |> kable()

```

## Working our way up from the root nodes

Religion is patterned by race but has no other determinants.

```{r religion}
data <- data |> mutate(
  religion = gen_religion(n, rel_cats, race),
)

data |> select(id, race, religion) |> sample_n(10) |> kable()

```

The following variables are determined by parents' values:

* `I`: Intelligence
* `SR`: Resilience
* `M`: Motivation
* `CE`: Community connections

```{r ind}
data <- data |> mutate(
  intelligence = gen_correlated(parent_intelligence, target_r = 0.5),
  resilience = gen_correlated(parent_resilience, target_r = 0.5),
  motivation = gen_correlated(parent_motivation, target_r = 0.5),
  community_connections = gen_correlated(parent_community_connections, target_r = 0.5),
)

data |> select(id, parent_intelligence, intelligence, parent_resilience, resilience, parent_motivation, motivation, parent_community_connections, community_connections) |> sample_n(10) |> kable()

```

The following variables are determined by a mixture personality, geography, and parents' values:

* Education (varies by personal traits and parents' class position)
* Cultural orientation (namely, trust of institutions; varies by parents class position, religion, geography, and commu nity connections)
* Job type (varies by educational attainment and parental income)
* Dependents (varies by income, job type, and age)
* Insurance (varies by job type, state conditions, age)
* Distance to provider (varies by state conditions)

```{r ind_ses}
data <- data |> mutate(
  edu = gen_education(n, ed_cats, intelligence, resilience, motivation, community_connections, parent_income, parent_edu),
  income = gen_incomes(
    n,
    median_income = 60000,
    sd = 25000,
    min_income = 0,
    max_income = 1000000
  ),
  cultural_orientation = gen_cultural_orientation(n, parent_income, parent_edu, pec, religion, community_connections),
  job_type = gen_job_type(n, job_type_cats, ed_cats, edu, parent_income),
  dependents = gen_dependents(n, income, job_type, age),
  insurance = gen_insurance(n, job_type_cats, job_type, pec, age),
  distance_to_provider = gen_distance(n, pec),
)

data |> select(id, edu, income, cultural_orientation, job_type, dependents, insurance, distance_to_provider) |> sample_n(10) |> kable()

```

Comorbidity is determined by age, SES, and other comorbidities.

* Obesity (varies by state conditions, age)
* Multiple gestation (varies by age, obesity)
* Diabetes (varies by age, obesity, income)
* Heart disease (varies by age, obesity, diabetes)
* Placenta previa (varies by multiple gestation)
* Hypertension (varies by age, obesity)
* Gestational hypertension (varies by hypertension, multiple gestation)
* Preeclampsia (varies by age, hypertension, gestational hypertension, multiple gestation)

```{r comorboidities}
data <- data |> mutate(
  obesity = gen_obesity(n, income, edu, pec, age, target_prevalence=0.35),
  multiple_gestation = gen_multiple_gestation(n, age, obesity, target_prevalence = 0.03),
  diabetes = gen_diabetes(n, age, obesity, income, target_prevalence = 0.1),
  heart_disease = gen_heart_disease(n, age, obesity, diabetes, target_prevalence = 0.15),
  placenta_previa = gen_placenta_previa(n, age, multiple_gestation, target_prevalence = 0.01),
  hypertension = gen_hypertension(n, age, obesity, target_prevalence = 0.2),
  gest_hypertension = gen_gest_hypertension(n, hypertension, multiple_gestation, target_prevalence = 0.05),
  preeclampsia = gen_preeclampsia(n, age, hypertension, gest_hypertension, multiple_gestation, target_prevalence = 0.02),
)

data |> select(id, obesity, multiple_gestation, diabetes, heart_disease, placenta_previa, hypertension, gest_hypertension, preeclampsia) |> sample_n(10) |> kable()

```

## Immediate causes of receipt of comprehensive postnatal care

Provider quality is determined by state conditions and already calculated.

Personal capacity (to attend visits) is determined by:

* dependents
* job type
* income
* distance to provider

```{r personal_capacity} 

data <- data |> mutate(
  personal_capacity = gen_personal_capacity(n, dependents, job_type, income, distance_to_provider)
)

```

Now generate the risk profile, which is a function of:

* provider quality (negatively correlated)
* age
* obesity
* multiple gestation
* diabetes
* heart disease
* placenta previa
* hypertension
* gestational hypertension
* preeclampsia

```{r risk_profile}
data <- data |> mutate(
  risk_profile = gen_risk_profile(n, provider_quality = providers$quality[match(data$provider_id, providers$id)], 
                                 age, obesity, multiple_gestation, diabetes, heart_disease, placenta_previa, hypertension, gest_hypertension, preeclampsia)
)

```

Now generate risk aversion, which we see as a function of the negative conseuqences from getting really sick and how much people want to avoid them.

* insurance (people without insurance will be more risk averse because of cost; positively correlated)
* provider quality (people with better providers will be less risk averse since they trust the care they can get; negatively correlated)
* risk profile (people with higher risk will be more risk averse since they will have more consequences if getting ill; positively correlated)

```{r risk_aversion}

data <- data |> mutate(
  risk_aversion = gen_risk_aversion(n, insurance, provider_quality = providers$quality[match(data$provider_id, providers$id)], risk_profile)
)
```

Provider trust is a function of:

* race/ethnicity (racial minorities are less likely to trust providers; negatively correlated)
* provider quality (people with better providers will be more likely to trust them; positively correlated)
* cultural orientation (people trusting institutions will be more likely to trust providers; positively correlated)


```{r provider_trust}

data <- data |> mutate(
  provider_trust = gen_provider_trust(n, re_cats, race, provider_quality, cultural_orientation)
)

```
And finally, willingness to pay, which we see as a function of:

* provider quality (people with better providers will be willing to pay more; positively correlated)
* income (people with higher income will be willing to pay more; positively correlated)
* insurance (people with insurance will be willing to pay more since they don't have to cover it out of pocket; positively correlated)
* risk aversion (people who are more risk averse will be willing to pay more; positively correlated)
* cultural orientation (people who trust institutions will be willing to pay more; positively correlated)

```{r willingness_to_pay}

data <- data |> mutate(
  willingness_to_pay = gen_willingness_to_pay(n, provider_quality = providers$quality[match(data$provider_id, providers$id)], income, insurance, risk_aversion, cultural_orientation)
)
```

Finally, we generate the outcome of interest, receipt of comprehensive postnatal care, which is a function of:

* personal capacity (people with more capacity will be more likely to attend visits; positively correlated)
* willingness to pay (people who are willing to pay more will be more likely to attend visits; positively correlated)
* provider quality (people with better providers will be more likely to attend visits; positively correlated)
* provider trust (people who trust their providers will be more likely to attend visits; positively correlated)
* risk aversion (people who are more risk averse will be more likely to attend visits; negatively correlated)
* risk profile (people with higher risk will be more likely to attend visits; positively correlated)

```{r gen_dv}

data <- data |> 
  mutate(
    received_comprehensive_postnatal_care = gen_received_comprehensive_postnatal_care(n, personal_capacity, willingness_to_pay, provider_quality, provider_trust, risk_aversion, risk_profile)
  )

```

We're going to include an income variable, but it's going to be censored and have measurement error.


```{r income_osberved}

sri_labels <- c("0–$25,000", "$25,000–$50,000", "$50,000–$75,000", "$75,000–$100,000", "$100,000–$125,000", "$125,000–$150,000", "$150,000–$175,000", "$175,000+")

data <- data |> mutate(
  self_report_income = cut(
      pmin(pmax(income + rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 5000), 0), 200000), # Add noise and cap
      breaks = seq(0, 200000, by = 25000),
      include.lowest = TRUE,
      right = FALSE,
      labels = sri_labels
    )
)

table(data$self_report_income)

analysis_data <- data |> select(
  id,
  provider_id,
  state,
  received_comprehensive_postnatal_care,
  self_report_income,
  age,
  edu,
  race,
  insurance,
  job_type,
  dependents,
  distance_to_provider,
  obesity,
  multiple_gestation,
  diabetes,
  heart_disease,
  placenta_previa,
  hypertension,
  gest_hypertension,
  preeclampsia
) |>
  mutate(
    self_report_income = as.character(self_report_income),
    job_type = as.character(job_type),
    dependents = as.character(dependents),
  ) |> 
  rename(
    race_ethnicity = race
  )

readr::write_csv(analysis_data, "data/simulated_data.csv")
